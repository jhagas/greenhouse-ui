# Greenhouse Monitoring System with ESP8266, Supabase, React (Web UI)

Here is step-by-step tutorial (Link to another online article) to setup your own web-based greenhouse monitoring system. Web user interface is made with React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](./REACT.md)), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/). You can follow those link to learn more, but as always the included project is more than enough to get you start monitoring your greenhouse.

## Hardware Required

- 3, 10 kilo ohm resistor
- 1, 1 kilo ohm resistor
- 1, ESP8266 (LoLiN NodeMCU v3)
- Stable Wi-Fi connection (for ESP8266 to send the data)
- Red LED
- USB type-A to USB cable data
- DHT22 Sensor (if you using the module not a standalone device, you only need 2 10k resistor)
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Phone Charger
- Laptop or Desktop with internet connection

## LDR Preparation

I can't ensure all the LDR's available out there build exactly the same. So calibration step should be taken. Tutorial for that can be seen here: [LDR Calibration for Arduino](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/design-a-luxmeter-using-a-light-dependent-resistor/).
