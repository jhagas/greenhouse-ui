# Greenhouse Monitoring System with ESP8266, Supabase, React (Web UI)

Here is step-by-step tutorial (Link to another online article) to setup your own web-based greenhouse monitoring system. Web user interface is made with React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](./REACT.md)), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/). You can follow those link to learn more, but as always the included project is more than enough to get you start monitoring your greenhouse.

## Hardware Required

- 1, 10 kilo ohm resistor
- 1, 1 kilo ohm resistor
- 1, ESP8266 (LoLiN NodeMCU v3)
- Stable Wi-Fi connection (for ESP8266 to send the data)
- Red LED
- USB type-A to microUSB cable data
- DHT22 Sensor (if you using the module, not a standalone device, you don't 10k resistor)
- BH1750 (Illuminance sensor)
- Phone Charger
- Laptop or Desktop with internet connection
